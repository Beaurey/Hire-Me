  <h1>Top 5 Reasons to Hire Beau</h1>

  <div class="wrapper">
    <div class="reason">
      <img alt="Storyteller Beau" src="images/1.jpg" />
      <div class="reason-content">
        <h2>1. I’m a professional storyteller</h2>
        <p>At least, that’s what I wish was on my business card!</p>
        <p>I love creating content because it’s a way to connect with people. In digital marketing, you hear “content is king” being bandied around a lot. I personally believe the user is king. You need to start at the beginning to tell the right story, and that’s what good content should be – a compelling story that genuinely speaks to the reader. This is why digital content excites me; it has moved from being dictated to the people to being created and dispersed by the people.</p>
        <p>While copywriting and optimising content for SEO is my bread and butter, I have much more to offer in terms of approaching content from a more creative and strategic side. At STEAK, I worked on a content campaign for a horizontal parallax infographic that aimed to provide education on health insurance. I was responsible for brainstorming the overarching idea, pitching to the client, briefing the designer on visuals and writing the copy.</p>
        <p>This year, I also volunteered to spearhead a charity project as part of the Dentsu Aegis One Day For Change (ODFC) initiative. A colleague and I devised a think tank around branding, social media, SEO and SEM recommendations, to help SecondBite create a digital buzz around an emerging project of theirs. The day was a great success, and our General Manager received a lovely note from the CEO of SecondBite, commending my colleague and I for our hard work.</p>

    <div class="reason">
      <img alt="" src="images/2.jpg" />
      <div class="reason-content">
        <h2>2. I’m a (people) mover and shaker </h2>
        <p>My official job descriptions revolve around content and SEO, but I’ve been not-so-secretly moonlighting as a coordinator. At STEAK, I liaised with freelance writers, briefing them on article topics before assigning each to various websites and blogs. In my current role, I’m the planner and facilitator of social events for the Melbourne office. Working within Dentsu Aegis, I have also collaborated with Isobar on a shared home building client and Haystac on creating a work experience program model for Columbus. These experiences have strengthened my belief in the power of clear communication and collaboration between open-minded parties.</p>
        <p>My MBTI type is ESFJ and I’m a Hufflepuff, which says a lot in and of itself. To put it simply, people are and will always be at the heart of everything I do. I care about loyalty, hard work, being a fair team player, sticking to my principles, and doing right by people – in both my personal and professional lives.</p>

    <div class="reason">
      <img alt="Arty Beau" src="images/3.jpg" />
      <div class="reason-content">
        <h2>3. I’m a perfectionist (but not a party pooper)</h2>
        <p>I’m that person in the office, the one who’s asked to proofread slides and review documents before they get sent off or go to print, who receives requests to double check and rewrite others’ emails. I have an eagle eye for spelling mistakes, grammatical errors and inconsistent formatting – so much so, I can feel myself making faces in presentations when I can spot multiple typos!</p>
        <p>Along with my innate meticulousness, agency life has taught me the importance of time management and personal organisation. Balancing the needs of clients with the internal demands of a constantly evolving digital company has helped me to better understand what processes work for me in terms of productivity and output. It’s still a learning curve, and one I’m pleased to continue developing as I meet new challenges in working life.</p>

    <div class="reason">
      <img alt="Crafted Beau" src="images/4.jpg" />
      <div class="reason-content">
        <h2>4. I work hard to embrace change</h2>
        <p>Having an adaptable personality isn’t inherent in my nature, but it’s something I work hard to constantly improve upon. As scary as I sometimes find being outside of my comfort zone, it’s a place where I often do my best work.</p>
        <p>At Columbus, I was brought on board primarily for my copywriting skills, with the aim of branching more into SEO. To quote Aladdin, it was a whole new world, full of meta data recommendations, technical audits, best practice documents, keyword ranking reports, and Google exams. I had to immerse myself very quickly, and while my heart still belongs to content marketing, bringing myself up to speed in SEO has broadened my skillset and allowed me a more holistic understanding of digital marketing, something I’m very grateful for.</p>

    <div class="reason">
      <img alt="Creative Beau" src="images/5.jpg" />
      <div class="reason-content">
        <h2>5. I’m traditionally "right-brained"</h2>
        <p>Throughout school, I was always naturally adept at English and the arts. It’s therefore unsurprising that my working life has been premised upon my aptitude in these areas, and that my extracurricular activities too sit within the creative sphere.</p>
        <p>Reading has been one of my favourite pastimes since youth and I also enjoy writing in my spare time, everything from fiction to personal essays, poetry to film reviews.</p>
        <p>Studying digital design in high school spawned an interest in Photoshop that I’ve sustained for the last six years. I use the program almost daily to edit photos and make gifs. I’m fairly obsessed with Tumblr and use it to discuss my favourite films, television shows and book series. As of August 2015, I have made almost 21,000 posts and acquired 16,500 followers, which seems incredible to me but is testament to the energy and passion I’ve poured into my account.</p>
